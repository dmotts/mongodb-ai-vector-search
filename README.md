# Movie Recommender Capstone Project

This Streamlit-based movie recommender project utilizes various natural language processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning models to recommend movies based on user input.

## Overview

This project aims to provide users with personalized movie recommendations by leveraging state-of-the-art NLP models for text embeddings and a MongoDB database for efficient storage and retrieval of movie data.

## Atlas Vector Search

Atlas Vector Search is a feature provided by MongoDB Atlas that allows for efficient and sophisticated searches on high-dimensional vector data. This is particularly useful in modern, data-driven applications where complex data types are common.

In the context of this movie recommender project, Atlas Vector Search is used to perform efficient searches on the high-dimensional vectors generated by the NLP models. These vectors represent the semantic meaning of the movie data, and Atlas Vector Search allows us to quickly find movies with similar vectors (i.e., similar semantic meanings) to the user's input.

## Features

- **Embedding Models**: Utilizes pre-trained Hugging Face models such as 'BAAI/bge-small-en-v1.5' and 'sentence-transformers/all-mpnet-base-v2' for generating text embeddings.
- **MongoDB Integration**: Interacts with a MongoDB database to store movie data and perform vector searches.
- **User Interaction**: Offers an intuitive user interface through Streamlit, allowing users to input their movie preferences and receive recommendations.
- **Logging**: Implements logging using Python's built-in logging module for better debugging and monitoring.

## Setup

- **Environment Setup**: Ensure you have Python installed. Install required dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
- **Configuration**: Set up environment variables such as `ATLAS_URI` in a `.env` file.
- **Run the App**: Execute `streamlit run app.py` to launch the Streamlit app.

## Usage

- **Input**: Enter your movie preferences in the provided text input.
- **Model Selection**: Choose an embedding model from the dropdown menu.
- **Recommendation**: Click the "Recommend Movies" button to receive personalized movie recommendations.

## Dependencies

- Streamlit
- dotenv
- requests
- pymongo
- pandas
- Hugging Face Transformers

## Future Improvements

- Implement user authentication and user-specific recommendations.
- Enhance UI with additional features such as movie trailers and ratings.
